### Project Chrome Extension : Leads tracker

- In this project I have created a chrome extension called "Leads tracker".
  - this extension will save the save url that user type in.
  - also by clicking `save tab` it will save the current url of the browser.
  - clicking `delete all ` will delete the all url that is saved by user, even from the local storage.
- this extension save the `URL` in local storage so user can see them even after closing the browser or system and commig back.
